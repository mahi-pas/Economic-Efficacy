# True Economy Measurement

## How am I going to determine the true effectiveness of an economy?

### Philosophical principles:
- The effectiveness of an economy is based on whether an average person can satisfy their needs, not a number being high
- Quality of goods used to satisfy needs explains difference between more developed economies. (A 4 bedroom house in America is nicer than a 4 bedroom house in India, or even just nicer areas). This is difficult to measure, so we will ignore this factor. :(
- A person's needs are the following categories:
    - Survival: food, shelter, water, clothing (which we will ommit since cost of clothing is dependent on taste, some people can wear the same clothes for years), childcare, healthcare
    - Basic Needs(*try living in society without these*): Electricity, Internet, Mobile Plans, Car

### Data to track:
- Median Income
- Yearly Cost of 4 Bedroom Home (Mortgage)
- Yearly Cost of Childcare/Education
- Yearly Cost of Groceries
- Yearly Cost of Water
- Yearly Cost of Electricity <- Yoav, you do this cost and under
- Yearly Cost of Internet
- Yearly Cost of Mobile Plans
- Yearly Cost of a car
- Yearly Cost of Healthcare

### Formula
- Median income's difference between the costs of essentials

### Drawbacks
- Doesn't account for one off necessary purchases, such as a new phone, clothes, etc.
