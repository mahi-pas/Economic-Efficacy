# True Economy Measurement

## How am I going to determine the true effectiveness of an economy?

### Philosophical principles:
- The effectiveness of an economy is based on whether an average person can satisfy their needs, not a number being high
- Quality of goods used to satisfy needs explains difference between more developed economies. (A 4 bedroom house in America is nicer than a 4 bedroom house in India, or even just nicer areas). This is difficult to measure, so we will ignore this factor. :(

### Data to track:
- Median Income
- Cost of 4 Bedroom Home
- Cost of Childcare
- Cost of Groceries
- Cost of a car
- Cost of Healthcare

### Formula
- Median income divided by the costs
