# True Economy Measurement

## How am I going to determine the true effectiveness of an economy?

### Philosophical principles:
- The effectiveness of an economy is based on whether an average person can satisfy their needs, not a number being high
- Quality of goods used to satisfy needs explains difference between more developed economies. (A 4 bedroom house in America is nicer than a 4 bedroom house in India, or even just nicer areas). This is difficult to measure, so we will ignore this factor. :(
- A person's needs are the following categories:
    - Survival: food, shelter, water, clothing (which we will ommit since cost of clothing is dependent on taste, some people can wear the same clothes for years), childcare, healthcare
    - Basic Needs(*try living in society without these*): Electricity, Internet, Mobile Plans, Car

### Data to track:
- Median Income - county? https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/median-household-income-by-state
- Yearly Cost of 4 Bedroom Home (Mortgage) - county? https://www.self.inc/info/house-prices-by-state/
- Yearly Cost of Childcare/Education https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/child-care-costs-by-state
- Yearly Cost of Groceries https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/grocery-prices-by-state
- Yearly Cost of Water https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/water-prices-by-state
- Yearly Cost of Electricity <- Yoav, you do this cost and under
- Yearly Cost of Internet
- Yearly Cost of Mobile Plans
- Yearly Cost of a car
- Yearly Cost of Healthcare

### Two configurations


### Formula
- Median income's difference between the costs of essentials

### Drawbacks
- Doesn't account for one off necessary purchases, such as a new phone, clothes, etc.
- Or other expenditures that aren't necessary but are important such as investment, extra education, extracurriculars, dating

## How to run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python main.py`
