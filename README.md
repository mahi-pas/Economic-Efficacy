# Economic Efficacy Map

## How am I going to determine the true effectiveness of an economy?
In the last election, people complained about the economy being bad while politicians said the GDP was rising. Both were correct, but talking about different things. We need to measure the economy based on things that matter to average people. Hopefully this report can move us closer in that direction. 
- Whatever you choose as the metric for sucess will be optimized for

### Philosophical principles:
- The effectiveness of an economy is based on whether an average person can satisfy their needs, not a number being high
- Quality of goods used to satisfy needs explains difference between more developed economies. (A 4 bedroom house in America is nicer than a 4 bedroom house in India, or even just nicer areas within the country). Economic Efficacy does not measure quality, only if the goods arrive.
- A person's needs are the following categories:
    - Survival: food, shelter, water, clothing (which we will ommit since cost of clothing is dependent on taste, some people can wear the same clothes for years), childcare, healthcare
    - Basic Needs(*try living in society without these*): Electricity, Internet, Mobile Plans, Car
- This is based on if you want to be frugal

#### Helpful secondary data
- State populations https://worldpopulationreview.com/states

### Datapoints:
- Median Family Income - 4 people
- Yearly Cost of Rent
- Yearly Cost of Childcare for two children
- Child Tax Credit
- Yearly Cost of Grocery for 3.5 people
- Yearly Cost of Water
- Yearly Cost of Electricity
- Yearly Cost of Internet
- Yearly Cost of Mobile plans for 4 people
- Yearly Cost of Used car+insurance 
- Yearly Cost of Healthcare


### Two configurations
- Single person ?
    - No childcare
    - Housing is in rent? 
- Two Parent Household, two kids -> Focus on this
    - Double the income
    - Quadruple groceries (or maybe 3.5, children eat less)
    - Double the car
    - Quadruple the healthcare
    - Double the childcare
    - Quadruple Mobile plans

### Formula
- Income = Median income - taxes
- Income's difference between the costs of essentials
or
- Percentile of income that can afford the basics + 100/200 to save each month

### Assumptions
- 

### Drawbacks/Limitations
- Doesn't account for one off necessary purchases, such as a new phone, clothes, etc.
- Or other expenditures that aren't necessary but are important such as investment/savings, extra education, extracurriculars
- People who are parents would be making more, single people would make less
- Taxes for each data point?
- Don't factor owning a home, since it's harder to calculate a monthly cost for it given variables like downpayment
- Does not include child tax credits per state, that would be its own project
