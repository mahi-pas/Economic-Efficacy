# True Economy Measurement

## How am I going to determine the true effectiveness of an economy?

### Philosophical principles:
- The effectiveness of an economy is based on whether an average person can satisfy their needs, not a number being high
- Quality of goods used to satisfy needs explains difference between more developed economies

### Data to track:
- Median Income
- Cost of Home
- Cost of Childcare
- Cost of Groceries
- Cost of a car
- Cost of Healthcare

### Formula
- Median income divided by the costs
